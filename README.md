# hm3-passwordGenerator

## Password Generator web page made by Ignacio Diaz

This is a homework where the creation of password generator is the main task using JavaScript.

To complete this task successfully I used a variety of variables such as arrays, strings and integers.
I tried following best coding practices and keep as clean and readable the code as possible.

I also used iterations to validate information provided by user and make sure the program would not get stuck at some point.

Please find below a screenshot of a password 128-character long generated using my application.
